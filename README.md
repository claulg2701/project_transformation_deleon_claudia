## Comments

I really enjoyed working on this project. It seemed a bit intimidating at first, but I was able to deliver a mobile solution that allows readability of this web page content in different screen devices.

Using the [browser syncing](https://browsersync.io/) helped testing across multiple browsers and devices.
